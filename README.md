# Cloud Cafe

This is a project for brushing up my skills on Firestore. The goal of this project is to create a cloud cafe homepage where users can view the top 4 highest-rated cafes, add new cafes, and delete existing cafes.

## Features

The Cloud Cafe Homepage has the following features:

1. **Viewing the top 4 highest-rated cafes:** Users can view the top 4 highest-rated cafes on the homepage. The cafes are ranked based on their average rating.

2. **Adding new cafes:** Users can add new cafes to the database by filling out a form on the homepage. The new cafe will be added to the Firestore database and will be displayed on the homepage.

3. **Deleting existing cafes:** Users can delete existing cafes by clicking on a delete button next to each cafe on the homepage. When a cafe is deleted, it will be removed from the Firestore database and will no longer be displayed on the homepage.
## Technology Used

1. **Firebase Firestore:** A NoSQL document database that is part of the Firebase platform.
2. **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
3. **Tailwind:** A popular CSS framework for building responsive, mobile-first websites.
